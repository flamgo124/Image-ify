# Image-ify
  Make EVERYTHING whatever you want! Simply install the mod then start your game! A folder will generate named "Image-ify". That's where you put your image! :D

# How do I do that exactly?
  It's simple! Just follow these 5 easy steps!

# Tutorial

  1. Put the mod in your Plugins folder

  2. Run your game

  3. Close your game (optional unless you want to actually use the mod)

  4. Drop your awesome image into your game path (Gorilla Tag/BepInEx/plugins/Image-ify/)

  5. Lastly, have fun! :D


# Things you should probably know
When you put your own image it doesnt have to have the same name :D
